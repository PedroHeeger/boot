[!] Looks like I didn't find any open ports for 10.10.50.2. This is usually caused by a high batch size.

*I used 4500 batch size, consider lowering it with 'rustscan -b <batch_size> <ip address>' or a comfortable number for your system.

 Alternatively, increase the timeout if your ping is high. Rustscan -t 2000 for 2000 milliseconds (2s) timeout.
